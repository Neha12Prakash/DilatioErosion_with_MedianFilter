Dilation and Erosion
->Basic morphological operations

->Basics of dilation: 
 -->Increases the object area
-->Used to enhance features

->Algorithm of dilation:
-->A kernel is a matrix of odd size(3*3 or 5*5) is convolved with the input image.
-->A pixel element in the original image is 1 if at least one pixel under the kernel is 1.
-->the foreground object increases 
 


->Erosion: 
-->Erodes away the boundaries of the foreground object.
-->Used to shrink the features of an image.

-->A kernel is a matrix of odd size(3*3 or 5*5) is convolved with the input image.
-->A pixel in the original image (either 1 or 0) will be considered 1 only if all the pixels under the kernel are 1
-->otherwise, it is made to zero or eroded.
-->Due to erosin, all the pixels near the boundary will be discarded depending upon the size of the kernel.
-->So the thickness or size of the foreground object decreases.
